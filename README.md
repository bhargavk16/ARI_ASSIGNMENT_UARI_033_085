## AR Furniture Showcase App

## Introduction

This project's primary goal was to create an augmented reality application that makes use of Unity's features to present a variety of furniture appliances in an interesting and educational way. 

## Use Cases

### Efficient Space Utilization

The AR app can help with room layout design and planning for architects and space planners. The app can assist in making the best use of available space and guarantee that furniture fits comfortably in the given area. 

### Virtual Furniture Placement

Before making a purchase, users can virtually arrange furniture pieces in their physical spaces using the augmented reality app. They can see how the furniture will appear in their house or place of business, which facilitates better decision-making. 

### Interior Design

The app allows interior designers to test out various furniture configurations, colors, and styles in real-time. This can help by giving a 	virtual sneak peek at how the room will look when it is all finished. 

### Enhanced User Experience

The app's interactive features improve the planning phase user experience by encouraging innovation and collaboration among stakeholders. 

## Functionality

The app detects a plane from the camera input, and when the user taps on the desired furniture appliance, the app places the furniture appliance in the selected location virtually inside the AR Space.

## Compatibility

The app works for any Android device above the Android 7.0(Nougat) version.
